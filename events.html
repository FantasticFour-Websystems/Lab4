              <h3>Gamma Nu Eta Tutoring</h3>
                <p>Tutoring is conducted in-person at the ITWS Lounge, which is located on the second floor of the Lally Building, right across from Linda Kramarchyk's office. All you need to do is show up at the appropriate time to receive tutoring.

                  At these tutoring sessions, Gamma Nu Eta can help you with any course in your ITWS degree program. This includes ITWS core classes, or other essential courses such as Computer Science 1 or Data Structures . We can also help with any questions that you might have about career development, resumes, as well as just general questions about RPI.</p></p>
